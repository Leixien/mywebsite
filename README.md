# My WebSite

The goal of this site is to get me to share projects Iâ€™m working on and random things I find interesting. 
This website is only meant to do two things: <b><i><U>load fast</i></b> and <b><i><U>look good on mobile</U></i></b>.

This website has undergone many re-writes but the current version is a static site built using Jekyll. 
The pages are written in HTML/CSS, and most of the content is written in Markdown. 
All that good stuff served straight from GitHub.

The default theme and stylings are dark but your system can request a light theme.
